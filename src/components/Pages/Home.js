        Mathematics is the cradle of all creations,
        without which the world cannot move an inch.
        Be it a cook or a farmer, a carpenter or a mechanic,
        a shopkeeper or a doctor, an engineer or a scientist,
        a musician or a magician, everyone needs mathematics
        in their day-to-day life. Even insects use mathematics
        in their everyday life for existence.
